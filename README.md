# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Statisitical analysis of automobile performance with R
## Overview
AutosRUs' new MechaCar is "suffering from production troubles" and the company is hoping that an analytical review may help provide some insight. The goal of this project is to:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a study to compare the MechaCar performance against vehicles from other manufacturers.
## Results
### Linear Regrssion to Predict MPG
